Server-Status-Tracker
=====================

NodeJS app to keep track of the sites you run, its free and you can even host it on free NodeJS hostings like Heroku and AppFog

Usage
-----

Currently you can add your sites by editing the sites array in app.js, I'll be adding support for redis database and UI for adding
and removing sites from the server as well as some basic authentication mechanism.
